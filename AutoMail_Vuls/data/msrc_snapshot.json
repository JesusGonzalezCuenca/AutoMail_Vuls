Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that an attacker send a malicious link to the victim via email, or that they convince the user to click the link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message. In the worst-case email attack scenario, an attacker could send a specially crafted email to the user without a requirement that the victim open, read, or click on the link. This could result in the attacker executing remote code on the victim's machine. When multiple attack vectors can be used, we assign a score based on the scenario with the higher risk (UI:N).",

The word Remote in the title refers to the location of the attacker. This type of exploit is sometimes referred to as Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE). The attack itself is carried out locally. For example, when the score indicates that the Attack Vector is Local and User Interaction is Required, this could describe an exploit in which an attacker, through social engineering, convinces a victim to download and open a specially crafted file from a website which leads to a local attack on their computer."

      "According to the CVSS metric, user interaction is required (UI:R) and privileges required is low (PR:L). What does that mean for this vulnerability? The attack requires to trick a user to open an SMB share folder that is hosted on the attacker-controlled system. Windows Explorer has to automatically register for directory change notification after opening the share folder.",
      "What type of information could be disclosed by this vulnerability? An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could potentially read small portions of heap memory.",
      "How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability? To successfully exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need to direct a user to connect to the malicious SMB server to retrieve some data as part of an OS API call.",
      "According to the CVSS metric, the attack complexity is high (AC:H). What does that mean for this vulnerability? For this vulnerability, it is out of attacker's control to trigger the OOB read buffer to be sent back to the attacker-controlled system.",
      "According to the CVSS metrics, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a high loss of confidentiality (C:H), no effect on integrity (I:N) and some loss of availability (A:L). What does that mean for this vulnerability? There is a high likelihood that the Out-Of-Bounds (OOB) read data results in a crash in Windows Explorer. Every time the SMB client sends the OOB read data to the remote SMB server and a crash does not occur, it would contain several bytes of random user mode heap memory."

Why are IE Cumulative updates listed for Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2? While Microsoft has announced retirement of the Internet Explorer 11 application on certain platforms and the Microsoft Edge Legacy application is deprecated, the underlying MSHTML, EdgeHTML, and scripting platforms are still supported. The MSHTML platform is used by Internet Explorer mode in Microsoft Edge as well as other applications through WebBrowser control. The EdgeHTML platform is used by WebView and some UWP applications. The scripting platforms are used by MSHTML and EdgeHTML but can also be used by other legacy applications. Updates to address vulnerabilities in the MSHTML platform and scripting engine are included in the IE Cumulative Updates; EdgeHTML and Chakra changes are not applicable to those platforms. To stay fully protected, we recommend that customers who install Security Only updates install the IE Cumulative updates for this vulnerability."

      "Is the Preview Pane an attack vector for this vulnerability? No, the Preview Pane is not an attack vector.",
      "According to the CVSS metric, the attack vector is local (AV:L). Why does the CVE title indicate that this is a remote code execution? The word Remote in the title refers to the location of the attacker. This type of exploit is sometimes referred to as Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE). The attack itself is carried out locally. For example, when the score indicates that the Attack Vector is Local and User Interaction is Required, this could describe an exploit in which an attacker, through social engineering, convinces a victim to download and open a specially crafted file from a website which leads to a local attack on their computer."
